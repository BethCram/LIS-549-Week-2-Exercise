                        The University of Washington offers Study 
                        Abroad programs and this Summer A term, one of the Study Abroad programs is
                    going to Netherlands to study Dutch academic, research, 
                    and cultural organizations such as the DANS (Data Archiving and Network Services),
                    their national eHumanities platform, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences, 
                    and several other exciting organizations! </p>
                
                    <p>"The program will examine how innovation works in library, information, and museum 
                        services, practices, and designs in the Netherlands and Belgium. It will look at 
                        what, exactly, “innovation” means in institutional settings; the interplay between 
                        culture and values in program design; the ways libraries and museums work with diversity; 
                        research, assessment, and the process of making a case for innovation; and 
                        innovation-focused program assessment. We will also look at digital humanities and 
                        digital scholarship in general and the role(s) they play in innovation in the contemporary 
                        library and museum worlds. We will explore these in topics as well as questions of how the
                         cultural-heritage sector deals with the legacy of colonialism, neoliberalism, and 
                         contemporary social problems in both the Netherlands and the U.S"
